About Chronia

Chronia is a simple and easy-to-use focus timer app that helps you stay productive and focused during your work or study sessions. The app is designed to help you break your work into manageable intervals and give yourself regular breaks to recharge and refocus.
How It Works

Chronia uses the popular Pomodoro Technique to help you manage your time and focus better. The technique is based on the idea of breaking your work into 25-minute intervals (called "pomodoros") and giving yourself a short break (usually 5 minutes) between each interval. After every 4 pomodoros, you can take a longer break (usually 15-30 minutes) to rest and recharge.

Chronia makes it easy to follow this technique by providing a simple and customizable timer that counts down each pomodoro and break interval. You can set the duration of each interval and adjust the number of pomodoros and breaks to fit your work style and schedule.
